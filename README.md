## Electric Vehicles Analysis

### Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook dedicated to analyzing data on electric vehicles (EVs). The analysis explores critical aspects of the electric vehicle industry, such as battery capacity, range, charging time, and energy efficiency. The goal is to offer insights that are informative for both industry analysts and consumers considering EV options.

### Contents
The repository includes:
- **Data Loading and Cleaning**: Preparation of the dataset for analysis, including data cleaning, handling missing values, and formatting adjustments to ensure consistency.
- **Data Analysis**: Exploration of key metrics related to electric vehicles, supported by data visualizations and statistical summaries.
- **Insights and Findings**: Highlighted observations that uncover patterns, trends, or interesting comparisons within the electric vehicle landscape.

### Data Analysis
The data analysis section is structured to investigate multiple dimensions of EVs, such as:

1. **Battery Capacity and Range**: Analysis of battery capacity data to understand the relationship between battery size and vehicle range. This section might use correlation analysis, scatter plots, and regression models to identify trends.
   
2. **Charging Time**: Exploration of charging time data to gauge typical durations for different vehicle models. Histograms or box plots are used to visualize distribution and identify outliers or standard charging benchmarks.

3. **Energy Efficiency**: Examination of energy efficiency metrics to compare how different EVs perform in terms of energy consumption, possibly using comparisons between EVs and traditional internal combustion engine vehicles if data is available.

4. **Market Trends**: Investigation into the evolution of EV technology over time, looking at changes in battery capacity, range, and price. This analysis might involve time series plots to highlight trends in EV specifications over recent years.

5. **Environmental Impact**: Analysis of how EVs contribute to emission reductions and environmental benefits, compared to traditional vehicles. Carbon footprint reduction, fuel savings, and lifetime emissions data may be used to quantify benefits.

### Requirements
To run the notebook, install the following dependencies:
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn` (if machine learning models are included)
